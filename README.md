## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Navigate between Home, Movies, TV Series, and Bookmarked Shows pages
- Add/Remove bookmarks from all movies and TV series
- Search for relevant shows on all pages

## My process

### Built with

- SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Router DOM
- React Redux
- React Redux Toolkit
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

1. Improve navigation style for mobile (the four links should be centered);
2. Improve the card container style for mobile (show more content on the screen);
3. Refactor the Recommended, Movies, TVSeries and Bookmarks components into a single reusable component due to similarities in the styles and the structure;
4. Refactor the filter-slice.ts reducer functions into a single function.
5. Add error elements for each route
